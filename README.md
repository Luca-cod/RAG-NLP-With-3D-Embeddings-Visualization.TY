Implementation of 3D visualization Embeddings.
I have use the numpy library for representing the embeddings in a vectore dimension space in 3D.
With the t-SNE library i have transformed the dimesion of the embeddings from 268D in 3D, internament the function preseved the relationship of points locals similarity.
